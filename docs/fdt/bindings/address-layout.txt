Generic address space layout bindings

These bindings describe the layout of a device's physical address map.
This is used primarily to describe regions of memory for program storage
and memory (e.g., ROM, RAM, flash).

The core's address space layout should be described in /memory, which
contains a subnode for each region of memory.

Required properties:
    - compatible: must be "address-layout"
    - #address-cells: must be <1>
    - #size-cells: must be <1>

Region subnode properties:
    - reg: start address and size of region
    - attr: string describing region attributes, in the same format as
        LD's MEMORY attr string[1].
