Clocks bindings

Clock bindings describe the clocks that a peripheral is connected to.

Clock providers required properties:
    - #clock-cells: Number of clock specifier cells

Clock users specify the clocks they use in the "clocks" property.

Required properties:
    - clocks: List of multiple clock provider entry.  Each entry begins
          with the provider phandle, followed by #clock-cells specifiers

Optional properties:
    - clock-names: String list of clock names, in the same order as the
          clocks property
