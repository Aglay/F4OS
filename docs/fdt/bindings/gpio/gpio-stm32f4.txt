GPIO for STM32F4 chips

Required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "stmicro,stm32f407-gpio"

When referencing GPIOs in a GPIO property, the valid GPIO numbers can be found
in arch/armv7m/chip/stm32f40x/include/gpio.h in enum stm32f4_gpios.

Only the standard FDT GPIO flags are supported.  These are documented in
gpio-prop.txt.
