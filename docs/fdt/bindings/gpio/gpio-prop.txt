GPIO property bindings

When referencing a GPIO, the GPIO property consists of three cells:
    - phandle to GPIO device controlling the GPIO
    - GPIO number on the device
    - GPIO flags, defined below and by the GPIO device

Global valid GPIO flags are found in include/dev/hw/gpio.h:
    - GPIO_FDT_ACTIVE_LOW (1 << 0): GPIO is active low
