STMicro STM32F4 DMA bindings

DMA controllers should specify #dma-cells = <2>.  The first cell is
the DMA stream number.  The second cell is the stream channel number.
Duplicate dma-names may be provided, if they offer the same functionality.

Required properties:
    - compatible: Must be "stmicro,stm32f407-dma"
    - reg: register base address and register map size
    - #dma-cells: Must be 2
    - stmicro,periph-id: STM32F4 Peripheral ID associated with the peripheral
