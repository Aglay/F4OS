DMA controller and client bindings

DMA controllers required properties:
    - #dma-cells: Number of dma property cells

DMA clients required properties:
    - dmas: List of DMA channel cells.  Each cell begins with
        the controller phandle, followed by #dma-cells specifiers
    - dma-names: String list of DMA names, one for each DMA channel.
